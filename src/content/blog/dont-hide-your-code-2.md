# Don't Hide Your Code

In the modern era of software development, the impulse to protect "proprietary" logic is often counterproductive. This article explores why transparency is your greatest asset.

## Why Transparency?

> "Transparency is not about showing everything, it's about making sure the important things are visible." — _Someone Wise_

1.  **Trust**: Clients trust you more when they see how you work.
2.  **Quality**: You write better code when you know others might read it.
3.  **Speed**: Open systems are easier to debug and integrate.

### Features of Markdown You Can Use

You can do almost anything here!

#### 1. Code Blocks (with highlighting)

```typescript
function calculateTrust(transparency: number, competence: number): number {
  return transparency * competence;
}

const myTrustScore = calculateTrust(1.0, 0.95);
console.log(`Trust level: ${myTrustScore * 100}%`);
```

#### 2. Lists

- **Ordered Lists**
  1.  First step
  2.  Second step
- **Checklists**
  - [x] Write code
  - [x] Show code
  - [ ] Profit?

#### 3. Tables

| Feature   |  Hidden   | Transparent |
| :-------- | :-------: | :---------: |
| Debugging |   Hard    |    Easy     |
| Security  | Obscurity |  Verified   |
| Hiring    | Difficult |  Showcased  |

#### 4. Images & Media

#### 5. Math (if supported)

The relationship between code quality $Q$ and developer ego $E$:
$$Q \propto \frac{1}{E}$$

### Conclusion

Stop hiding. Start sharing. Your code is your resume, your proof of work, and your bridge to the community.
